Get-ChildItem "C:\Windows\system32\*" | ForEach-Object { try { Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath $_.FullName -ErrorAction Stop } catch {} }

```

**common directories that malware typically uses to store files, execute malicious code, or maintain persistence:**

**recommendation:** check These pathes for suspicous files if you see some executables dlls check the sign

**_A Quick trick:_** you can use sort by "Access Modified" when viewing files by hand or script, many .dmp files like the ones mimikatz generates can found quickly because user often doesn't access these types of files. time is the key but keep in mind is not important in first look cause can be edited easily by attackers and should be checked more detailed in forensic and specific tools.


| **Directory**                                       | **Description**                                                                                         |

Usefull Commands for this part :
```powershell
Get-process
tasklist
```
common indicators for identifying suspicious processes in Windows using the `tasklist` and `Get-Process` commands in PowerShell:

| **Indicator**                    | **Description**                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unusual Process Names**        | Look for processes with names that seem out of context or are similar to legitimate processes but slightly altered.        |
| **High CPU or Memory Usage**     | Processes that consume an unusually high percentage of CPU or memory resources may indicate malicious activity.            |
| **Unexpected Parent Processes**  | Processes spawned by unfamiliar or suspicious parent processes can indicate exploitation or injection.                    |
| **Running from Uncommon Paths**  | Processes located in temporary directories (`%TEMP%`, `%APPDATA%`) or non-standard folders may be suspect.               |
| **No Digital Signature**         | Check if the process is unsigned or has an invalid signature, especially for system-critical processes.                    |
| **Network Activity**             | Processes initiating unexpected network connections (identified by using `Netstat` alongside process information).        |
| **Unexpected User Context**      | Processes running under unfamiliar user accounts or SYSTEM privileges can be suspicious.                                  |
| **File Modifications**           | Processes modifying system files or registry entries unexpectedly can indicate malicious behavior.                        |
| **High I/O Operations**          | High disk input/output activity from a process may suggest unauthorized data exfiltration or system compromise.           |
| **Multiple Instances**           | Multiple instances of the same process running simultaneously can be a sign of malware behavior.                         |

---

### Network Auditing

```powershell
Netstat -ano  # for check connections Established/listening ports and check IP addresses for suspicous connections,ports etc...
```

common indicators of suspicious connections that may warrant further investigation in a network environment:

| **Connection Type**             | **Description**                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unusual Remote IP Addresses** | Connections to known malicious IPs, suspicious geolocations, or previously unauthorized addresses.|
| **High Frequency Connections**   | Rapid or excessive outbound connections to the same or different IPs, indicating possible exfiltration or scanning activities.|
| **Uncommon Ports**              | Traffic on non-standard ports (not typical for HTTP, HTTPS, FTP) can signify bypass attempts or exploitation.                     |
| **Peer-to-Peer Traffic**        | Connections involving P2P protocols may indicate the use of file-sharing malware or unauthorized data transfer.                  |
| **Connections to Known C2 Servers** | Traffic to command and control (C2) servers known for distributing malware or controlling compromised systems.               |
| **Frequent DNS Lookups**       | Excessive DNS queries to specific domains, especially by a single application, can indicate the presence of DNS tunneling or malware. |
| **Localhost Connections**       | Unexpected connections from external IPs to localhost (127.0.0.1) can indicate loopback exploitation or tunneling. |
| **Unencrypted Traffic**         | Sensitive information transmitted over unencrypted connections (HTTP instead of HTTPS) can lead to data leaks or man-in-the-middle attacks. |
| **Connections During Odd Hours** | Traffic during unusual times (outside of normal operating hours) can signify malicious activity or unauthorized access attempts. |
| **Suspicious User-Agent Strings** | Unexpected or uncommon user-agent strings in HTTP traffic might indicate automated scripts or malware attempting to communicate. |


## Event IDs 

Keep in mind This is one of the most important parts of threat hunting in windows evniroments.

You can use tools like `DeepBlueCLI`/`APT-Hunter` for automated checking...

```powershell
# Detecting RDP BruteForce using 4625 EventID from Security logs (Also check this on SIEM)
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='Security'; Id=4625} | Measure-Object
Get-WinEvent -LogName Security -InstanceId 4625 | Select-Object * | Measure-Object

# Filter by time
Get-winEvent -FilterHashTable @{ logname="Security"; starttime="9/9/2021" endtime="9/10/2021" }

# Check for encoded powershell commands
Get-Winevent -LogName 'Windows Powershell' | Where-Object { $_.Message -match '(--EncodedCommand| -enc| FromBase64String| Encoded)' | Select-Object *

# Check for script downloaders
Get-winevent -LogName 'Windows Powershell' | Where-Object { $_.Message -match 'Invoke-WebRequest| Invoke-RestMethod| curl| wget' } | Select-Object *
```



## **Top Common Event-IDs you check:**

### **1. Logon/Logoff Events**

| **EVENT ID** | **Description**                                                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## 6. USB Device Driver Information (via Device Manager)

You can also gather USB device details through **Device Manager** for detailed information:

| **Location**       | **Description**                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Device Manager** | Under **Universal Serial Bus Controllers**, you will find information about each connected USB device and hub.                   |
| **Device Manager** | Right-click on a device and select **Properties** to see detailed information such as **Driver**, **Resources**, and **Events**. |

## 7. USB Device GUIDs for Profiling

You can also use **GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers)** for device classes to better profile USB devices:

| **Device Class** | **GUID**                                 |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **USB Devices**  | `{36FC9E60-C465-11CF-8056-444553540000}` |
| **USB Storage**  | `{A5DCBF10-6530-11D2-901F-00C04FB951ED}` |
| **USB Hubs**     | `{F2A1B809-5E5A-464E-BD4E-2107F85D9A35}` |
